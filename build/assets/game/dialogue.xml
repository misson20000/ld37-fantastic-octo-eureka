        Oh, it's simply awful. All I know is that after we woke up the next morning, we all had terrible hangovers, but Brianna saw a fire in the pit outside and decided to go put it out. Five, ten minutes later she comes back in sobbing and wailing waking everyone up. Once we calmed her down enough to figure out what was going on, she told us there was a... a corpse in the firepit... Mr. Smith called the cops, the rest of us were in shock.

        I had... oh I don't know, four, five cups of wine? Probably more. Enough to regret it in the morning.

        I was rather drunk through most of it, but I do remember one odd thing... the server boy- don't remember his name, he kept on talking to people and then writing it down in a little notebook of his.

        Heavens no, I didn't. I tried to ask him about it, and he said he was writing down connections or something. Rather peculiar if you ask me, but I never liked that boy in the first place. He tried to flirt with my sister and she could do far better than him.

        She's brilliant, beautiful, righ, sweet, and cunning. She deserves someone much better than a street rat like him. Apparently, he's an orphan from New York. No family, no friends, nothing to his name but the clothes on his back, but the Smiths let him work for htem. He's damn lucky, that boy, but not lucky enough to get Brianna.
